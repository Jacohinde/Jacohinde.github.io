<h1>MEXICAN CIVIL WAR</h1> <br>
<h2><u>Amadeo Jacohinde</u></h2>
<br>
<p>We were by now so used to seeing soldiers and gendarmes on the streets and malls, to have so many rifles so close to the house, that no great difference was even noticed when the war broke out. It's not that we didn't feel threatened by the bullets, but being so close to death no longer scared us as before. It also turned out that we liked guns. We took our rifles to the movies, to the beach and libraries, and we made it a habit to always go to the bathroom with a revolver in hand. But in general terms, life kept going as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>It was funny when foreigners came to "rescue" us from our hell. Came so sure of helping with their plans of salvation and their ideas of peace. We tried to be understanding and make them understand that we are not fans of happiness nor do we want to know about redemption, this is how our world has always been and we are part of all this. Sometimes they tried to convince us, then we could not help laughing and they got offended.</p>
<p>They arrived with the enthusiasm to share us their hope and left with the confused feeling of having been so naive to believe we needed them in the first place. In the full candor of such a bloody war, we were just fine.</p>
<p>It was my wedding day when I learned that the army shot my parents and my sister on the way. I felt like collapsing and I was about to cancel everything, but just on time we were informed that my sister managed to get the rifle and the grenades and annihilated half a convoy before they could shoot her down. I looked at my wife and we smiled together. Someone opened the champagne and in honor of her bravery and heroism we celebrated the most eccentric wedding of those days. Of course the war changed us all, we were unrecognizable and we didn't care.</p>
<p>"I had to wait," my wife told me one night, "I had to wait for a battle to end in the mall to be able to go back and get my change right."</p>
<p>The world was paralyzed before us. It was unusual. And it was novel because this was not another side war, you couldn’t distinguish between enemies and allies. It used to be said that this was a war between the government, drug lords and political opposition, where only one would be left with victory and power.</p>
<p>But that was the official narrative, the simplest version of the conflict. The actual number of sides, troops, and armies was uncountable; this was more of mass hysteria than traditional warfare. We all took the opportunity to exact revenge and settle past scores. It was a massacre of broken tribes where everyone was a potential enemy and only -though not always- could we trust the family.<p>
<p>After 5 years of conflict, foreigners no longer came to the country with the intention of humanitarian aid; now mercenaries, guerrillas, terrorists and arms dealers came from all over the world with pride in joining the slaughter. Even international organizations were no longer making any attempt to intervene. We stopped being the tragedy and now we were the Big Show of the Century. Nobody disapproved of us anymore.</p>
<p>But that didn't make matters worse either: it’s impossible to alter the order and shape of our world. Many of those who came determined to die heroically in battle, far from home, eventually settled here, raising families and practicing a trade until they grew old with the pride of having fought in the civil war and having laughed at Death in her own face.</p>
<p>We Mexicans do not idealize things that much. We will never feel guilty or seek compassion, but neither do we ask for applause. What had to happen happened and we did what had to be done. We never had the intention to take away the world of its innocence.</p>
