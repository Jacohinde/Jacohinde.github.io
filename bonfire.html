<h1>THE GREAT FLARE</h1> <br>
<h2><u>Amadeo Jacohinde</u></h2>
<br>
<p>There was only one bonfire in the whole world and it lasted thousands of years, some say it was ten millennia. This is how humans discovered fire. A nomadic tribe one day came across a huge bundle of logs and leaves burning in giant, promising flames. Fascinated by the great flare, they gathered around it and stayed there. Someone extended a branch to the fire and everyone saw that it was consumed. They soon realized that it would be necessary to get more branches and more leaves to keep the flame alight: they had to "feed the god" or he would die and then they too would die. But this was the beginning: it was five magnificent years of peace for the tribe who had the privilege of arriving first. What could these people know about all the wars, truces, negotiations, and betrayals that were necessary to defend control of the Great Flare, where they were finally defeated and dispossessed?</p>
<p>We don't know for sure if this happened somewhere in Egypt or Mesopotamia. We do know that six years later the word got out and then countless tribes came from everywhere. The Great Bonfire became the world stage for struggle, cooperation, rules, crimes, and invasions - all primal elements of Civilization. The legends were scattered everywhere and the conquerors emerged glorious. Centuries and centuries of uninterrupted fire that increased and decreased incessantly, with times of weakness where everyone feared "the end of the world" and times of intensity where hope returned.</p>
<p>The new generations came and went, the winter winds, the first words arrived and even after so many centuries the first God of men was still alive; it had many names, spoke many languages, and sheltered so many "chosen peoples" until the day the catastrophe came in the form of rain. It was all over in a matter of minutes. Devastated, the humans saw God die before their eyes and could do nothing. Shortly after came the snow that covered the Earth. It had to be the end. Nobody thought there would be a second chance for the gods or for humans, but "the legend" had already been born, that idea of a will, of the secret word; it was just a matter of time and clime.</p>
