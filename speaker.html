<h1>THE SPOKESMAN</h1>
<h2><u>Amadeo Jacohinde</u></h2>
<br>
<p>Humanity imagined many trades and generated many other professions, but in the vast history of Civilization there was only one man who could perform a job that no one else has been or will be able to do. A job that only happened once. Edgar Carano was the first and the last "Spokesman" of the criminal and insurgent groups and leaders of the whole world. It was a specific moment in the history of the species. A thing of fate, having been born when the media was just entering the digital world and organized crime acquired a power as great as that of the hegemonic governments.
</p>
<p>Edgar represented the voice of those who were too dangerous and too wanted to speak for themselves to the world. "The prophet of murderers and thieves," used to call him the moralists of the time. After all, he represented the forbidden voices of Civilization.
</p>
<p>He was not a criminal, he was not even close to committing a crime; but he never was a "good person" or tried to be one, and this made him so interesting. Since he was a child, indifferent to good and evil. He had nothing against crime; he didn't support criminals but neither did he have the slightest willingness to stand in their way. He understood like no one what the world of a criminal is, he knew the inevitable mechanisms of violence and he did not have the impulse to judge or measure the destiny of other lives.
</p>
<p>For many he was the most interesting man in the world. In the darkness of his past all kinds of legends and myths took refuge: some said that he was the prelude to a new global political agenda, which would allow the simultaneous existence of criminal and civil States to see which ones would acquire greater power; others claimed that in his early youth he was traveling around the country aimlessly until a group of politicians and capos from Sinaloa gave him the job.
</p>
<p>Edgar was studying college when the government infiltrated him into criminal groups, and by the end of his career he had already earned the trust of the great bosses in the nation. He was a much better intermediary than a spy, and without knowing what he was doing is how he started his trade. His career grew at the pace of lightning, since criminals had the most effective referral system on the planet. Three years later he was already recognized in the world as the first and only "Spokesman" of all time. Always on the go and always busy: have an early breakfast at an Italian estate with activists and spend the night in a Moscow bar with the elite of the Russian mafia, for example. From the age of 27 this was his daily life.
</p>
<p>Conferences on television, international forums, at the United Nations as well as courts in The Hague. The most important thing about his job, however, was always the private negotiations. Entrepreneurs with politicians, criminals with businessmen, politicians and criminals: Edgar Carano was at the center of the dynamics of the modern world, at the secret core of all the important events of his time.
</p>
<p>When the princesses of Scotland were kidnapped, he negotiated ransom with Parliament and managed to free them without a scratch, giving the Irish militia a good image. Mexican cartels won social sympathy thanks to Edgar, and in Argentina they composed a hymn for him for his role in the history of a new "constitutional crime regime." Everywhere they celebrated his talent to speak on behalf of criminals and give birth to a new philosophy of the world and of life.
</p>
<p>And after three years the world was preparing for their offspring. Suddenly we started talking about his legacy, about the next "spokesmen" and how we would recognize them. We wanted to know if there would be some kind of certificate or academy, or if it would be simply a matter of luck and experience. The doors of a world were opening before us where the civilian population would work in cooperation with companies, governments and mafias. We would have the global economy of a solar civilization.
</p>
<p>But we were wrong: Edgar did not represent the arrival of a new era. The world that came with him also disappeared with him. At the age of 39, he died in an accident and four days later the civil governments started the war against the criminal governments. There were no more deals or negotiations, world crime lost its voice forever. Neither the politicians nor the druglords wanted to deal with another middleman. Neither have we wanted another Speaker among the humans. Edgar Carano was so great and so fitting for his destiny that it's not worth trying again. No one can repeat it. And nobody wants to do so because we're sure there is a long time to go.
</p>
<p>"That man," said a parliamentarian, "knew the heights that we have not yet imagined. Today is not tomorrow. It is dangerous to go ahead and force the inevitable destiny of Humanity."</p>
